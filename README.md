# Medical diagnostic startup company

Just imagine that you are a CEO of a start-up company in medical diagnostics. You are planning to launch a new diagnostic tool to _detect diabetes in women using easily available information without invasive testing_. You want to convince investors to invest in your company and you need to given them a report with the potential of your test.

The easily available values we will utilize include:
1. **pregnant**: Number of times pregnant
2. **glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration at 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
3. **diastolic**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
4. **triceps**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
5. **insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
6. **bmi**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in metres squared))
7. **age**: Age (years)

We have conducted a clinical trial involving 768 women, where we recorded whether or not they had diabetes (the outcome of the test). The data from this trial is available on the repository.
